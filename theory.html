            <h1>Relating Theory</h1>
            <div id="unit1" class="unit">
                <h2>Relating Theory</h2>
                <p>Relating is that which one person does to another, or to others, so it is a characteristic of an individual. Relating can apply as much to what happens in an instant as to what happens over the course of a lifetime; so offering someone a seat on a bus is as much relating as is being someone who goes through life needing to help people. A person can relate as much to internalized people and to people in the real world. Birtchnell wrote in his book (Birtchnell, 1993/96a) that relating is so essential a part of our being that we never stop doing it, just as our hearts never stop beating.</p>
                <p>Relating theory, previously called spatial theory, began to take shape in the late nineteen eighties. It grew out of considerations of the nature of psychological dependence. Its link with psychological dependence was apparent in an early form of it (Birtchnell, 1987). It grew during a period when he had frequent contact with John Bowlby, and another formative influence was his attempt to draw a clear distinction between it and attachment theory (see Birtchnell, 1997a). Bowlby died in 1990. As early as 1991, Professor Russell Gardner wrote, "Dr Birtchnell's spatial schema has considerable potential for analyzing data on interpersonal relationships." It was Maurice Lorr (personal communication, 1987) who first brought to his attention its resemblance to interpersonal theory, a theory which he himself had helped to develop (Lorr & McNair, 1963). In two papers (Birtchnell, 1990 and Birtchnell, 1994) he outlined the differences between his own theory and interpersonal theory. Spatial theory, as it was then called, was first fully developed in his book, How Humans Relate: A New Interpersonal Theory, published first as a hardback (Birtchnell, 1993) and later as a paperback (Birtchnell, 1996a).</p>

                <p>Of the theory, Professor A.T. Beck (Philadelphia) wrote (in the ASCAP Newsletter 1994), "I am convinced that John Birtchnell is on to something important in terms of his vertical and horizontal axes." Professor Paul Gilbert wrote, "He is to be congratulated for bringing together such a diverse literature and shedding new light on the complexities of human relating." (both quotations on the cover of the paperback). " Professor Russell Gardner (Texas) wrote, in the Foreword to the book, "Until now we have had no one comprehensive system for organizing and systematizing people's communicational attributes." Denis Trent (1994) in a review of the book, wrote "Birtchnell's theory is comprehensive and well thought out. Hidden within the content, however, is his ability to present a highly complex and well-integrated theory in a clear and easily understandable style." Carolyn Reichelt (1994) wrote, "When John Birtchnell's spatial model of relating first appeared in the ASCAP Newsletter, I was somewhat dubious. I suffer from a bias against trying to jam the complexity of the human spirit into little compartments. But in this case, further essays had increasingly piqued my interest, so that when called and asked if I would like to review the book, I agreed. It seemed worthwhile to see if a full exposition of the theory would be persuasive enough to quell my remaining doubts. I'm glad I did, because I'd have missed an enjoyable and stimulating read if I'd refused. I recommend this book to anyone interested in human feelings and interactions; not just professionals, but any intelligent reader”.</p>

                <h2>The essentials of relating theory</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Relating occurs along two intersecting axes, a horizontal one, concerning a need for involvement with others (closeness) versus a need for separation (distance), and a vertical one, concerning a need to relate from above downwards (upperness) versus a need to relate from below upwards (lowerness).</li>
                    <li>The theory proposes four states of relatedness: upper close, lower close, upper distant, and lower distant.</li>
                    <li>The emotions convey to us whether we are on course in attaining and maintaining the states of relatedness.</li>
                    <li>Whilst we are born with innate dispositions to the four states of relatedness, we need in the course of maturation, to develop competence in attaining and maintaining each of them.</li>
                    <li>A person who is competent in all states of relatedness is called versatile.</li>
                    <li>Competent relating is called positive, and relating that falls short of competence is called negative. One of the objectives of psychotherapy is the elimination of negative relating.</li>
                    <li>There are four intermediate states that result from a blending of a horizontal state and a vertical state. These are called upper close, lower close, upper distant, and lower distant. The four pure states (which are called neutral) and the four intermediate states are organized into a theoretical structure that is called the interpersonal octagon.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <div id="unit3" class="unit">
                <h2>Being related to</h2>
                <p>Just as we relate to people all of the time, we are being related to (by others) all of the time. We do not always know that we are being related to. A celebrity is unaware of all the feelings that all kinds of other people have towards her/him. All that applies to relating applies also to being related to. It can apply as much to what happens in an instant as to what happens over a lifetime. It can apply as much to internalized people as to people in the real world. People can be profoundly affected by the way that certain others relate to them. Relating and being related to are combined in the process of interrelating, and the CREOQ (see below), which measures interrelating, has separate measures of relating and being related to.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="unit4" class="unit">
                <h2>Classes of negative relating</h2>
                <p>Classes of negative relating are forms of relating incompetence. Since people need to relate in order to attain desirable states of relatedness, even if they cannot relate competently to attain them they will relate incompetently to do so. The three main forms of negative relating are called avoidant, insecure, and desperate. In avoidant relating, the person is so frightened of a particular state of relatedness that she clings desperately to the opposite state. Thus, a person who is frightened of closeness clings to distance. Insecure relating means that the person tries to attain or maintain a particular state of relatedness but is constantly afraid s/he is going to lose it. Thus an insecurely upper person is constantly trying to put other people down so as not to be dislodged from her/his position of upperness. Desperate relating means that the person will do anything to get or keep a particular state of relatedness, irrespective of what it does to the other person. Thus a desperately close relater will impose her/his closeness upon another even if s/he is not welcome. A desperately lower person will plead and beg and feign helplessness in order to get others to relate downwards to her/him. The measures of relating (see measures of relating section) are predominantly measures of negative relating.</p>

                <h2>The difference between relating and interrelating</h2>
                <p>Whereas relating is a characteristic of a person, interrelating is a characteristic of a pair of people (or sometimes of a number of people). When two people are interrelating each is both relating to and being related to by the other. Interrelating can be brief (as when a person makes a purchase in a shop) or can be extended over a period of time (as in a long term relationship). The CREOQ (see below) is a measure of interrelating.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="unit6" class="unit">
                <h2>Relating theory as the basis for the measurement of relating and interrelating</h2>
                <p>Relating theory was developed largely as a basis for the design of instruments for the measurement of relating; though once it had become established it became a useful aid for understanding a person's relating behaviour, as for instance in psychotherapy.</p>
                <p>A person's general relating tendencies can be measured by means of the Person's Relating to Others Questionnaire (PROQ) or various derivatives of it. Objectively, it can be measured by the checklist called Observation of Relating Behaviour (ORB).</p>
                <p>All measures of interrelating are based upon a cluster of four questionnaires by which each of two people rate how s/he relates to the other and the other relates to her/him. The main measure of interrelating was designed for use with couples and is called the Couple's Relating to Each Other Questionnaire (CREOQ).</p>

            <div id="unit7" class="unit">
                <h2>Relating theory and personality disorders</h2>
                <p>Relating theory is useful in the classification of personality disorders (Birtchnell, 1996b, 1997b; Birtchnell & Shine, 2000) and also in their treatment (Birtchnell & Bourgherini, 2000)</p>

            <div id="unit8" class="unit">
                <h2>Relating theory in psychotherapy, couple therapy and family therapy</h2>
                <p>Relating theory has particular application in the diagnosis of relating difficulties as they present in psychotherapy, couple therapy and family therapy and in the development of strategies for treating them.</p>

            <h1>Relating in Psychotherapy</h1>
            <img src="assets/images/theory/cartoon.png" width="470" height="300">
            <p>This is the title of his book that was first published (by Praeger) in hardback in 1999 and published (by Brunner-Routledge) in paperback in May 2002. The object of the book is to apply relating theory (see section on Relating Theory ) to what goes on in psychotherapy. Chapters describing relating theory alternate with chapters describing how the theory can be applied to the relating of both different kinds of psychotherapist and different kinds of client. Chapter 9 describes the questionnaires for measuring relating and interrelating (see section on Measures of Relating and Interrelating ), and indicates how these can be used in the initial assessment of the psychotherapy patient, or the couple seeking couple therapy, and for the assessment of improvement at stages through therapy and at the end of therapy.</p>
            <p>It needs to be stressed that, whether or not the therapist or the client is aware of it, and whatever form of therapy is used, relating forms a major part of what gets talked about in therapy, and relating deficits get corrected over the course of therapy.</p>
            <p>Towards the end of the book the term relating therapy emerges, to refer to a form of psychotherapy in which therapist and client (or a couple), work collaboratively together to correct specific relating deficiencies. In relating therapy, more so than in other forms of therapy, the part played by the relating of others towards the client is focused upon, and the circular nature of relating and being related to is explained. The client is helped to devise strategies for coping with the negative relating of certain key others towards her/him, or the client may even be advised to limit her/his involvement with such key others.</p>
            <p>An integral component of relating therapy is the use of a measuring instrument (see section on Measures of Relating and Interrelating) to indicate areas of deficiency and to serve as a monitor of change.</p>
